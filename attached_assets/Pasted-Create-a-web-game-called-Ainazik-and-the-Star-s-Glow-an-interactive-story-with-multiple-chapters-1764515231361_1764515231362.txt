Create a web game called “Ainazik and the Star’s Glow” — an interactive story with multiple chapters and simple mini-games. The game should have a warm, magical New Year atmosphere. It must run in the browser using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

STORY STRUCTURE (include in dialogues and scene descriptions):

Ainazik discovers an old New Year star while cleaning the attic. The star once illuminated the town every New Year’s Eve, bringing people hope and warmth.

Ainazik begins a journey through different parts of the town and forest to recover them and restore the star’s magic.
